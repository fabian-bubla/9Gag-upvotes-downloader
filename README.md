# 9Gag-upvotes-downloader
Downloads all the pictures and videos you upvoted on 9Gag
I made this for a friend.

**Setup**
1. Make sure you have all the required packages installed. (selenium, bs4)
2. You need to have Chrome installed for chromedriver to work.
3. Request the html file of your Data from your 9GAG Account
On 9Gag.com in Settings > Privacy & Safety > "Request my Data"
3. Replace the .html file you got via e-mail with the "Your 9GAG data.html" that is currently in the folder.

**Running the script**
1. Run the script.
2. Once it says 'Browser ready' and has opened the window you have 8 seconds time. In those 8 seconds you need only to click away the 9GAG privacy Pop-Up. Do nothing else.
3. The programme will run by itself. Depending on how many upvotes you have made it can take a long while. Make sure your pc doesn't go to sleep and then step away and idk call your mom.
